- 👋 Hi, I’m Allay Abdessamad
- 👀 I’m interested in backend development, and writing high-performance and secure software. I am also interested in distributed systems and high-performance computing (HPC). I am attracted to Java and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) because of their power and flexibility. I am aiming to become a DevSecOps engineer. I am also interested in API development and architectural styles.Unfortunately, frontend development is not my sword.
- 
- 🌱 I am currently exploring Docker, Kubernetes, and delving into Spring and JVM.
- 💞️ My future plan revolves around delving into the field of machine learning and deep learning, focusing on their mathematical foundations
